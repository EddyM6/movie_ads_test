# AdMob SDK Enhancements

This document summarizes the key changes and improvements made to the AdMob SDK module.

## Core Architecture Improvements

1. **Provider Type Abstraction**
   - Added `AdProviderType` sealed class to support multiple ad providers
   - All provider implementations check provider type before initializing

2. **Builder Pattern for Configuration**
   - Replaced mutable properties with a builder pattern for better immutability
   - Allows for easy, fluent configuration through chainable methods
   - Configuration updates can be done through a lambda-based API

3. **Context Injection**
   - Now using constructor injection for Context rather than passing it as a parameter
   - Improved usage of Koin for dependency injection
   - Each component gets exactly the dependencies it needs

## App Lifecycle Tracking

1. **Improved Activity Tracking**
   - Centralized activity tracking in the base `AdApplication` class
   - App modules now implement `getCurrentActivity()` to provide current active activity
   - Cleaner separation of concerns between SDK and app

2. **Interstitial Ad Display Logic**
   - Better handling of ad display timing
   - Every second app open triggers interstitial display
   - Preloading ads for better user experience

## UI Enhancements

1. **Native Ad Components**
   - Jetpack Compose UI components for easy integration
   - Error states and loading placeholders
   - Example usage in a regular screen flow

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error messages and states
   - Retry capabilities for failed ad loads
   - Graceful degradation when ads cannot be loaded

## Documentation

1. **Updated README**
   - Clear instructions for implementation
   - Example code for common use cases
   - Architecture explanation for future maintainers

2. **Usage Examples**
   - Sample code showing how to integrate ads into app screens
   - Complete implementation examples

## Future-Proofing

1. **Abstraction Layers**
   - All ad functionality behind interfaces
   - Clean separation between provider-specific code and core functionality
   - Ready for multiple ad provider implementations

2. **Extension Points**
   - Clear places to add new provider types
   - Configurable behavior through injectable components

These enhancements significantly improve the maintainability, flexibility, and usability of the AdMob SDK module while ensuring it follows SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns.
